## Project Overview:

This repository houses the code and SQL queries crafted for the Consumer Goods module of the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Codebasics. In this project, I will analyze a consumer goods dataset, focusing on extracting insights and answering ten targeted ad hoc requests using SQL. The dataset features information from AtliQ Hardwares, a prominent global company specializing in manufacturing PCs, printers, mice, and computers.

## Project Structure.

   **1.** SQL Files:
   
  - Each SQL file includes queries tailored to address the ten ad hoc requests, efficiently extracting and processing the data required to provide clear answers.

   **2.** Project Presentation Files.

  - The PowerPoint file presents a detailed overview of the project, highlighting its objectives, approach, and key insights.
